# Home Automation System using Sensors, Arduino, MQTT, and Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project implements a smart Home Automation System that uses sensors and microprocessors (Arduino) to monitor and control home devices. Communication between devices and the central server is managed through the MQTT protocol, with a Raspberry Pi serving as the main server for real-time automation and remote management.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration:** Supports various sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.) for comprehensive home monitoring.
- **Microprocessor Control:** Utilizes Arduino boards to interface with sensors and execute device control commands.
- **MQTT Communication:** Employs MQTT protocol for lightweight, real-time, and reliable communication between devices and the server.
- **Centralized Management:** Raspberry Pi functions as the central server, handling automation logic, data processing, and remote access.
- **Remote Access:** Control and monitor home devices from anywhere via a web or mobile interface.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino (microcontroller programming)
- Sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.)
- MQTT protocol (e.g., Mosquitto broker)
- Raspberry Pi (server, automation, and data processing)
- Python/Node.js (for server-side scripts)
- Web/Mobile interface (for user control and monitoring)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-system.git
   cd home-automation-system
   ```

2. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect sensors to Arduino boards as per the circuit diagrams.
   - Set up the Raspberry Pi and ensure it is connected to your network.

3. **Install Necessary Software:**
   - Install MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) on Raspberry Pi.
   - Install dependencies for Arduino sketches and server-side scripts.

4. **Upload Arduino Code:**
   - Use the Arduino IDE to upload the sensor code to each Arduino board.

5. **Configure MQTT and Server:**
   - Update MQTT topics and server configuration files as needed.
   - Start the server script on Raspberry Pi.

6. **Access the Interface:**
   - Open the web or mobile app interface to monitor and control your devices.

## Usage

- Monitor real-time data from sensors.
- Control appliances or devices remotely.
- Set up automation rules (e.g., turn on lights when motion is detected).
- View logs and analytics for home activity.
